Rossland dog dirt App

The principal client file is Hello_leaflet1.htm, this is a internet map of the area, but from this you can load data into the app by calling Hello_Form1.htm

Server side Hello_GeoJSON2.php queries the data base and outputs results in GEOJSON to client, Hello_rdp.php just gives a download of contents of database in HTML to client
